I am a Postdoc Fellow in [https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/mla/ Machine Learning and Analytics Group] at [https://www.lbl.gov/ Lawrence Berkeley National Lab], where I am working with Prof. [https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/ Michael Mahoney]. I am also a visiting Postdoc at [https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/ International Computer Science Institute (ICSI)], where I work closely with Dr. [https://www.benerichson.com/ Ben Erichson]. I received my Ph.D. at Northeastern University in July 2022, where I worked with Prof. [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PaxAtLkAAAAJ&hl=en/ Hao Sun] and Prof. [https://sites.google.com/view/uirlab/ Ryan Wang]. I was also fortunate to collaborate with Prof. [https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/hajjar-jerome/ Jerome F. Hajjar], Prof. [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=34upg6YAAAAJ&hl=en/ Yang Liu], and Prof. [http://sites.nd.edu/jianxun-wang/ Jian-Xun Wang].


I am broadly interested in AI methods for scientific problems. I am working on both the methodology and application sides of scientific machine learning. Specifically, I work on soft and hard-constrained machine learning, super-resolution, and generative modeling. I apply these methods to many scientific domains, e.g., fluid dynamics, climate science, seismology, and earthquake engineering.
